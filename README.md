Advanced Programming Practical Exam

Different tasks have been conducted based off a scenario of a Fitness Tracker Data Analysis. The scenario is a dataset that is publicly on Kaggle and aims to have different activities done. Different activities were creating a sample dataset creating it easier to read and edit, allocate it within SQLite, create visuals of the sample data providing different diagrams and graphs accordingly. Optimizing the concurrency and performance of the code providing an insight of how fast it is running with different amounts of users. Furthermore, testing to ensure that the code is robust and testable making it functional for the users.

Computer issues occured with issues branching out the Kaggle Dataset and the python code. However, the sample code that was requestsed was used in this case with time timestamp, steps, heart_rate or sleep_duration. Plugins and software such as Python, VS Studio Code and matplotlib were not installed meaning it was robust and hard to complete tasks on a newly used computer although majority of tasks should meet the intended requirements.
